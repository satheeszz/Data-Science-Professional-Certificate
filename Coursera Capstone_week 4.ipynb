Considering a well-known tourist destination, Singapore already has a lot websites in place to recommend places to visit or stay. However, all these available websites focus mostly on usual tourist attractions which may not be of interest for backpackers. <br> <br> The purpose of this project is to, <br>\n- Choose one of the recently opened MRT lines in Singapore, Downtown line (DT) and analyze the most common venues located along the MRT line so that visitors can choose a place to stay near any DT MRT station and explore all the venues. <br> \n- The project also intends to cluster the MRT stations based on the venues so that the visitors can choose to spend more time on the stations with venues of their interest.<br>\n- The project not only provides the top most common venues but also provides a table of 10 most common venues <br> <br>\n\nFor the project, MRT station names are extracted from the Wikipedia page on Singapore MRT lines and common venues in the neighborhood of MRT stations in downtown line <font> <br>\n"

Then the data has been modified to choose locations only in downtown line. <br> <br>\nFor the MRT stations of interest, location data has been retrieved using **Geopy package**. The top venues recommendations are retrieved from **Foursquare API**. FourSquare API to explore neighborhoods in selected towns in Singapore. The Foursquare API was also used to explore the most common venues along the downtown MRT line. <font> <br> \n"
